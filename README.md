# YUME

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

YUME is a technological platform for developing web based 3D applications. Its technology stack consists of many popular frameworks like node.js, express or three.js. The goal of this project is to provide a foundation for all kinds of 3D-based web applications (especially games). YUME is written in JavaScript.

## Why should i use YUME?

Developing a complex 3D application is a hard challenge. If you want to create a real product, working just with three.js or an other 3D library is sometimes insufficient. YUME integrates different frameworks to create one comprehensive platform with many useful features.

- Node.js and its modules provide server side features to meet multiplayer or storage requirements (accounts, highscores).
- Express provides features for creating server side web applications. Games can benefit of templating, sessions, authentication, compression, caching and more.
- Three.js is a great library for developing WebGL based 3D content.
- PubSubJS provides a topic-based publish/subscribe mechanism, so YUME can handle even complex communication within the application.
- Browserify guarantees modular programming style and robust dependency management.
- Grunt is our internal task runner and build tool.
- Bootstrap provides a basic HTML/CSS template.
- Less simplifies styling.

The demo-application shows different features of YUME.

- stage loading and changing (via loading screen)
- advanced First-Person Controls
- UI integration (modal dialogs, menus etc.)
- simple interaction system for First-Person adventures or shooters
- simple but fast collision detection
- i18n (text files for each local)
- elementary audio system based on WebAudio
- savegame and settings managers

## History

Human Interactive is an IT startup from Germany. Our goal is to develop 3D applications for the browser. YUME arises out of our first project "DESIRE", a First-Person Adventure. If you want an impression of our first trials, please visit our [product website](http://www.desire-the-game.com/). Thanks!
