Technically, it's a simple three.js mesh.</li><li><strong>Static Object</strong> (middle boxes): A static object is a three.js mesh and part of the collision detection. The player can't walk through a static object. The collision detection is calculated either via AABBs (left box) or OBBs (right box).</li><li><strong>Interactive Object</strong> (left box): An interactive object is also a three.js mesh and part of the collision detection. Moreover the user can interact with it (see label). In this example no action is assigned, so nothing happened when pressing 'E'.</li></ul><p>"
