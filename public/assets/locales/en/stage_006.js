Other examples: <ul><li><strong>Sound with limited distance</strong> (left box): The noise of the fire drops, the farther you go away of the source. Besides a stereo effect is created, which allows a spatial awareness.</li><li><strong>Directional Sound</strong> (right box): The ticking of the clock can only be heard in a specific angle. If you are behind the imaginary wall, you won't hear a sound.</li></ul>The internal audio pipeline allows adjustments of volume and effects(e.g. direction, filter) for each element."
