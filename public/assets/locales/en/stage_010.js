	"InformationPanel.Text": "<h3>Impostor</h3><p>An impostor is a billboard that is created on the fly by rendering a complex object from the current viewpoint into an image texture, which is mapped on the billboard. Impostors are very useful for rendering distant objects rapidly.</p><p>Sometimes it necessary to regenerate the impostor, e.g. when the viewpoint changes too much. To test this feature in YUME, use the following keys: <ul><li>Press \"i\" to toggle the visibility of the 3D objects.</li><li>Press \"g\" to generate the impostors.</li></ul></p>"
