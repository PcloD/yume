The demo shows three effects (grayscale, gaussian blur and vignette).</p><p>Because the browsers are currently not able to render off-screen with antialiasing, the edges have a jagged look in the current stage. One way to solve this problem is to apply an additional FXAA shader within post-processing.</p>"
