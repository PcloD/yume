	"InformationPanel.Text": "<h3>Water</h3><p>The water shader is one of YUME'S most complex components. It creates animated, real-time reflective & refractive, normal- and du/dv mapped water. The logic consists of two basic and independent components.<ul><li><strong>Reflector</strong>: The Reflector component is used to create reflective surfaces like mirrors, certain floors or liquids. The reflection is calculated via the stencil buffer or a framebuffer object, like in this case.</li><li><strong>Refractor</strong>: The Refractor component is used to calculate 3D objects behind a translucent material. According to the shader program the illusion of a real refraction can calculated very realistically.</li></ul></p>"
